## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive platform for tokenizing art works or assets into NFTs and offers advanced features like fractional ownership, allowing users to own parts of valuable NFTs, and liquidity pools for trading these fractional shares. It also includes basic on-chain governance mechanisms, enabling token holders to participate in platform decisions.

## Key Features

- **NFT Tokenization:** Create NFTs that represent ownership of digital art.
- **Fractional Ownership:** Divide NFTs into smaller, fungible tokens for accessible investment.
- **Liquidity Pool Integration:** Enable trading of fractional ownership tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
- **Governance:** Allow fractional token holders to participate in governance decisions.

## Smart Contracts

- **`contracts/assetNFT.sol`:** The core NFT contract for creating and managing assets NFTs.
- **`contracts/FractionalAssetNFT.sol`:**  Handles the fractionalization of NFTs, minting ERC-20 tokens, and basic governance functions.
- **`contracts/NFTmarketplace.sol`:**  Facilitates the listing and trading of NFTs (you might need to update this to interact with `FractionalArtNFT` for fractional ownership).
